## Adapter Pattern

[Adapter pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern) is a software design pattern (also known as Wrapper, 
an alternative naming shared with the Decorator pattern) that allows 
the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.
It is often used to make existing classes work with others without 
modifying their source code.
