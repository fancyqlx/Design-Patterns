## Command Pattern

[Command pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern) is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate
 all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. 
 This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values 
 for the method parameters.
