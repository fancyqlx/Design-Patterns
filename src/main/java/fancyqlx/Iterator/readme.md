## Iterator Pattern

[Iterator pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern) is a design pattern 
in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements.
 The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, 
 algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.
