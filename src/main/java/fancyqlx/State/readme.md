## State Pattern

[State pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern) is a
 behavioral software design pattern that implements a state machine
  in an object-oriented way. With the state pattern, 
  a state machine is implemented by implementing each individual state 
  as a derived class of the state pattern interface, 
  and implementing state transitions by invoking methods defined by 
  the pattern's superclass.
