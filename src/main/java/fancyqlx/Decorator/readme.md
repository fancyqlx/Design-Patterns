## Decorator Pattern

[Decorator pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, 
either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. 
The decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, 
as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern. 
The decorator pattern is structurally nearly identical to the chain of responsibility pattern, 
the difference being that in a chain of responsibility, exactly one of the classes handles the request, 
while for the decorator, all classes handle the request.
