## Template Pattern

[Template method pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern) is a behavioral design pattern that defines
 the program skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, 
 deferring some steps to subclasses.
 It lets one redefine certain steps of an algorithm without 
 changing the algorithm's structure.
 The template method is one of the twenty-three well-known patterns 
 described in the "Gang of Four" book Design Patterns.
