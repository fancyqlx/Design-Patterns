## Facade Pattern

Facade pattern (also spelled as façade) is a software-design pattern commonly 
used with object-oriented programming. The name is an analogy to an architectural façade.
A facade is an object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, 
such as a class library. A facade can:

- make a software library easier to use, understand, and test, 
since the facade has convenient methods for common tasks
- make the library more readable, for the same reason
- reduce dependencies of outside code on the inner workings of a library, 
since most code uses the facade, thus allowing more flexibility in developing the system
- wrap a poorly-designed collection of APIs with a single well-designed API
